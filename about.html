    <p class="about">
      My journey into software development began in early 2022,<br>
      I started learning Python, and like many developers my first lines of code were print("Hello world").<br>
      However my interest in software and technology was sparked long before 2022.

    <p class="about-2">
      In 2019 I received my bachelors in Women and Gender studies, the curriculum for this degree cultivated<br>
      my critical thinking, problem solving, as well as research and analysis skills, but most importantly<br>
      it inspired me to work to create a more equitable world. I learned technology is a great tool for improving<br>
      quality of life, whether that is through creating VR/AR environments for therapy, to designing robotic prosthesis<br>
      to help people with disabilites; the potential to help others through tech is limitless and makes me excited to be in this field!
    </p>
    <p class="about-3">
      In 2023 I recieved my certification for completing the Ada Developers Academy core curriculum in software engineering and<br> computer science fundamentals. I have experience with Python, Javascript, Flask, React, and I'm always learning more!<br> 
      In my work I highly value collaboration, creativity, learning, attention to detail, and approaching problem solving<br>
      from multiple perspectives. I dream of working with a team that aspires to create technology that is innovative, accessible,<br>
      and improves the quality of life for living beings.
